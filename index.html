    <p>
        The Redmi Note 10 is a budget smartphone that one would call an
        all-rounder since it does well at covering at the bases of what a good
        budget smartphone under 15K should offer. The phone is powered by the
        Qualcomm Snapdragon 678 chipset, a mildly-upgraded version of the
        Snapdragon 675 SoC. It brings other lucrative features in the sub 15K
        price segment such as a Super AMOLED display, a 48MP primary lens, a large
        5,000mAh battery, and an elegant design. The screen’s resolution is Full
        HD+ and it is 6.43-inches in size. You also get an 8MP ultra-wide camera
        which some phone manufacturers tend to skip at this price point. The 48MP
        lens takes good shots during the day and acceptable ones at night. In
        other areas, the phone is also IP53 dust and water resistant, which is
        also a rarity at this price point. So, you get a plethora of value for
        money features with the Redmi Note 10, however, the gaming performance, as
        per our tests, isn’t up to the mark. Alongside the Snapdragon 678 SoC, you
        have 4GB or 6GB LPDDR4x RAM and 128GB UFS2.2 internal storage. The
        processor coupled with the RAM keeps the phone functioning well in
        day-to-day activities. The large 5,000mAh battery is powered by a 33W fast
        charger included in the box.
